# puppet-modules
Some generic puppet classes.
Mainly parameterised classes.
I'm using with foreman/katello.
Use at your own risk.

Some codes used in these modules are reused code from other modules found in puppet forge but didn't do exactly what I needed it to do, so modified to suit the needs of my employer.
