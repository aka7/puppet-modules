# puppet-modules
Some generic puppet classes.
Mainly parameterised classes.
I'm using with foreman/katello.
Use at your own risk.

To use this module, as they are they need install build and install using puppet or just symlink without the username, i.e 

````
ln -s akarim-sites sites
ln -s akarim-solaris_project solaris_project
etc
````
